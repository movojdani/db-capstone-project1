Hi there

There are many files in my repository, but you only need the four files listed below.

1- LittleLemon_ER Diagram.mwb
	The data model (ER Diagram) in MySQL Workbench.

2- LittleLemon_ER Diagram.PNG
	Screenshot of ER Diagram in PNG format.

3- LittleLemonDB_ MySQL Workbench Data Export.sql
	The SQL file of the Little Lemon database schema.

4- Little_Lemon_Tableau exercise.twb
	The workbook that includes all worksheets and dashboards.

And another thing, I didn’t find any description of the ManageBooking stored procedure 
during the course, so you won’t find it in the database.

Thank you helping me.
